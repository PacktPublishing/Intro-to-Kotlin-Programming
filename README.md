## About the Video Course
Kotlin is an object-oriented language that primarily targets Android. You will learn how to set up the environment and take your first steps with Kotlin and its syntax. We will cover the basics of the language, including functions, variables, and basic data types. With the basics covered, the next chapters show how functions are first-class citizens in Kotlin and deal with the object-oriented side of Kotlin.
